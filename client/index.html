Schema markup is like giving Google, ChatGPT, and other AI search engines a cheat sheet about your content. Without it, they're just guessing. With it, you're 434% more likely to rank in featured snippets and show up in AI-generated answers."

One missing comma and the whole thing breaks. SuperSchema generates perfect, validated JSON-LD in seconds. Your time is worth more than wrestling with Schema.org documentation at midnight."

AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) helps you show up in AI-generated answers from ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, and other AI tools. Think of it as future-proofing your SEO. Schema markup is crucial for both, but especially for AEO since AI engines rely heavily on structured data to understand and cite your content."

It'll give you generic templates that miss crucial details. SuperSchema actually visits your URL, scrapes your real content, analyzes your page structure, automatically detects the right schema types, validates everything against Schema.org standards, and generates production-ready markup with your actual data. No hallucinations. No guessing. No manual data entry. Just accurate, complete schema that actually works."

Typically, search engines re-crawl and re-index your pages within a few days to weeks. You might see rich snippets appear faster, while ranking improvements can take a bit longer. The important thing: you're giving search engines and AI the data they need to understand and promote your content."
