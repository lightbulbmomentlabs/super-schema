# ðŸš€ DEPLOY: URL Library System Migration

## What This Adds
Creates the URL library system that allows users to:
- Save discovered URLs from their domains
- Track which URLs have schemas generated
- View comprehensive schema generation history
- Hide URLs they don't care about

## How to Deploy

1. **Go to Supabase SQL Editor**:
   https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/atopvinhrlicujtwltsg/sql/new

2. **Copy and paste the SQL** from `database/migrations/005_url_library.sql`

3. **Click "Run"**

4. **Verify**: You should see "Success. No rows returned"

## What Gets Created

**New Tables:**
- `user_domains` - Stores user's registered domains
- `discovered_urls` - Stores all discovered URLs for each user

**Schema Updates:**
- Adds `discovered_url_id` column to `schema_generations` table
- Creates indexes for optimal query performance
- Adds triggers to auto-update `has_schema` flag

**Benefits:**
- URLs are persisted across sessions
- No need to re-crawl every time
- Easy tracking of schema coverage
- Foundation for bulk operations

âœ… Done! The URL library system is now ready to use.
