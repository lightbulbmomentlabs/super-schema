  {
    question: 'Where do I paste these snippets?',
    answer: 'In the schema editor after generating your schema. Add the property inside the main schema object (after existing properties, before the closing }). Make sure to add a comma after the previous property.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need all of these properties?',
    answer: "No. Focus on \"Recommended Properties\" first (biggest score impact), then add \"Advanced AEO Features\" if you want to reach 90+. Only add properties where you have real data—never make up fake information."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I don't have some of this information?",
    answer: "Skip properties you don't have. Don't make up fake data—it's worse than leaving it blank. For example, if you don't have ratings, don't add fake aggregateRating data."
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I copy multiple snippets at once?',
    answer: "Yes! Just make sure to add a comma after each property (except the last one). Proper JSON formatting is important—each property needs to be separated by commas."
  },
  {
    question: 'Will this break my schema?',
    answer: "These snippets are valid schema.org properties. As long as you maintain proper JSON formatting (commas, brackets, quotes), your schema will remain valid. Use the grader to verify after making changes."
  },
  {
    question: 'How much will my score improve?',
    answer: "It depends on what you're missing. Adding a structured author can boost your score by 15-25 points. Adding all recommended properties can take you from a C to an A. Check the property impact table to see point values for each property."
