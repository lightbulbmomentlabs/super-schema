const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'What\'s the difference between AEO and SEO?',
    answer: 'SEO (Search Engine Optimization) focuses on ranking in traditional search results - think blue links on Google. AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) focuses on getting your content cited in AI-generated answers from ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, and other AI tools. SEO is about traffic. AEO is about being the answer. Both matter in 2025, but AEO is how you future-proof your visibility.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I still need SEO if I\'m doing AEO?',
    answer: 'Yes. AEO isn\'t a replacement for SEO - it\'s an extension. Strong SEO gets your content indexed and ranked, which helps AI platforms find it. AEO ensures AI can understand, extract, and cite your content. Use both strategies together for maximum visibility across traditional search engines, AI tools, and voice assistants.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I know if my AEO strategy is working?',
    answer: 'Check if your content appears in ChatGPT responses, Perplexity citations, and Google AI Overviews. Monitor featured snippet appearances in Google Search. Track brand mentions in AI-generated answers even if they don\'t link back (zero-click visibility still builds authority). Use tools like SuperSchema to ensure your schema quality score is 80+ for better AI citation chances.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Which schema types matter most for AEO?',
    answer: 'FAQPage, HowTo, and Article schema are AEO powerhouses. FAQPage directly answers common questions (perfect for AI). HowTo provides step-by-step guidance that AI loves to summarize. Article schema helps AI understand your content structure and authorship. Product, LocalBusiness, and Organization schema matter for specific industries. SuperSchema automatically detects which types you need.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can schema markup hurt my SEO?',
    answer: 'Only if it\'s wrong. Invalid schema gets ignored. Schema that doesn\'t match your visible content can trigger penalties. Duplicate or conflicting schema confuses search engines. But properly implemented schema? That\'s pure upside - better rankings, rich snippets, and AI citations. Always validate with Google Rich Results Test or use SuperSchema to generate error-free markup.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does it take to see AEO results?',
    answer: 'Schema implementation is instant, but search engines need time to re-crawl and re-index your pages. Featured snippets can appear in days to weeks. Ranking improvements take longer - typically 2-8 weeks. AI citation in tools like ChatGPT depends on when they refresh their training data or search indexes. The key: implement schema now so you\'re ready when AI platforms next update.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What\'s a good schema quality score?',
    answer: 'Aim for 80+. Scores of 90-100 mean your schema is complete and optimized with all recommended properties. 70-89 is solid but could be better. 50-69 means you\'re missing important fields. Below 50? Use AI refinement ASAP. SuperSchema shows quality scores and offers one-click optimization to boost your score automatically.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Why are listicles so effective for AEO?',
    answer: 'Listicles make up 32% of all AI citations - the highest of any content format. Why? They\'re structured, scannable, and answer-focused. AI engines love clear, numbered points that can be easily extracted and summarized. Pair listicles with proper schema (FAQPage or HowTo) and you\'ve got an AEO goldmine.'

          <p>
            Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) is the practice of optimizing your content so AI search platforms - ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, Claude, and others - can find, understand, and cite your content as the definitive answer.
          </p>
          <p>
            While traditional SEO focuses on ranking in search results (those blue links you're used to), AEO focuses on being the answer that AI engines deliver directly to users. No click required. No scrolling through results. Just your content, front and center, as the authoritative source.

            Here's the brutal truth: search behavior is fundamentally changing. ChatGPT usage grew from 400 million to 700 million users in just 5 months. "Asking" (essentially search) now makes up 51.6% of all ChatGPT interactions. Google AI Overviews serve over 1 billion users. By 2026, experts predict 25% of organic traffic will shift to AI chatbots and virtual agents.

      <!-- Why Schema Markup Is the Heart of AEO -->

        <h2 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold mb-6">Why Schema Markup Is the Heart of AEO</h2>
        <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-muted-foreground space-y-6">
          <p>
            Schema markup is how you speak machine. Think of it as a cheat sheet for AI engines - a way to tell them exactly what your content is about, who wrote it, when it was published, and why it matters.
          </p>
          <p>
            Without schema, AI engines are guessing. With schema, they know. And when AI knows exactly what your content offers, it's 434% more likely to appear in featured snippets and AI-generated answers.

                <p class="text-sm mt-2">
                  Schema markup bridges the gap between human-readable content and machine-extractable data. When you add schema, you're not just optimizing for search engines - you're making your content AI-ready.

          </div>

          <p>
            Here's why schema matters more for AEO than traditional SEO: AI engines don't have time to read your entire article and infer context. They need explicit signals. FAQPage schema tells them "here are questions and answers." HowTo schema says "here's a step-by-step process." Article schema provides authorship, publish dates, and topics.
