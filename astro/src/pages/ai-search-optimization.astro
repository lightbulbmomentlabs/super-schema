const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'What is AI Search Optimization?',
    answer: "AI Search Optimization is the process of structuring your content so AI-powered search engines like Google's SGE, Microsoft Copilot, Perplexity, and ChatGPT can understand, cite, and recommend it. Unlike traditional SEO which focuses on ranking web pages, AI search optimization ensures your content becomes a trusted source for AI-generated answers."
  },
  {
    question: 'How is AI search different from traditional Google search?',
    answer: "Traditional Google search returns a list of blue links ranked by relevance. AI search engines synthesize information from multiple sources to generate a single conversational answer. Instead of competing for position #1, you're competing to be cited as a source within that AI-generated response."
  },
  {
    question: 'Which schema types matter most for AI search?',
    answer: 'FAQ, Article, and HowTo schema are the most effective for AI search. FAQPage directly answers common questions (perfect for AI). HowTo provides step-by-step guidance that AI loves to summarize. Article schema helps AI understand your content structure and authorship. Product, LocalBusiness, and Organization schema matter for specific industries.'
  },
  {
    question: "How do I get cited by Google's SGE?",
    answer: "To get cited by Google's Search Generative Experience (SGE), focus on comprehensive answers with proper schema markup, high E-E-A-T signals, and structured content. Use FAQ and Article schema, answer questions directly, include expert credentials, and provide clear, factual information that AI can confidently cite."
  },
  {
    question: "Does schema guarantee I'll be cited by AI?",
    answer: "No, schema doesn't guarantee citations, but it dramatically increases your chances. Schema provides machine-readable context about your content. Combined with quality content, authoritative sources, and proper formatting, schema helps AI engines understand and trust your information enough to cite it."
  },
  {
    question: 'How can I track AI citations?',
    answer: 'Monitor AI citations by regularly searching relevant queries in SGE, Copilot, Perplexity, and ChatGPT (with browsing enabled). Document when your domain appears as a cited source. Track patterns in which content types and schema implementations get cited most often. Some enterprise tools like BrightEdge offer SGE tracking.'
  },
  {
    question: "Do I still need traditional SEO if I'm doing AI search optimization?",
    answer: "Yes. AI search optimization complements traditional SEO - it doesn't replace it. Many AI engines (like SGE and Copilot) rely on traditional search rankings to determine which content to cite. Strong SEO helps your content get indexed and found, while AI optimization ensures it can be understood and cited."
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does it take to see results?',
    answer: "Schema implementation is instant, but AI engines need time to re-crawl and understand your content. You might see citations appear within days to weeks, depending on how often AI platforms refresh their indexes or browse the web. The key: implement schema now so you're ready when they next update."

          <p>
            AI Search Optimization is the practice of making your content citation-worthy for AI-powered search engines. While traditional SEO focuses on ranking in search results, AI search optimization focuses on being the answer that platforms like Google SGE, Microsoft Copilot, Perplexity, and ChatGPT cite as authoritative sources.
          </p>
          <p>
            The shift is fundamental: users aren't clicking through 10 blue links anymore. They're asking AI engines for answers and trusting the sources AI cites. If your content isn't optimized for AI understanding, you're invisible to this massive and growing audience.
