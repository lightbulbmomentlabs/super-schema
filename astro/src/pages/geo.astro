const faqs = [
  {
    question: "What's the difference between GEO and AEO?",
    answer: "AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) focuses on getting your content cited in AI-generated answers - think featured snippets, AI Overviews, and voice assistant responses. GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) goes deeper: it's about becoming the training source AI models rely on. AEO is about being the answer. GEO is about being the source AI can't ignore. Both matter, but GEO builds long-term entity authority that persists across all AI platforms."
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need GEO if I already do SEO?',
    answer: "Absolutely. SEO gets you ranked in traditional search results. GEO ensures you're cited in AI-generated answers. By 2027, LLM traffic is projected to overtake traditional Google search. If you're only doing SEO, you're optimizing for yesterday's search behavior. GEO extends your SEO efforts - they synergize, not compete. Strong SEO gets your content indexed. GEO ensures AI can understand, cite, and train on it."
  },
  {
    question: 'How does schema help with GEO?',
    answer: "Schema is machine-readable credibility. AI models parse structured data to understand entities, relationships, authorship, and context. Without schema, AI has to guess what your content means. With schema, you're telling AI exactly who you are, what you do, and why you're authoritative. Organization, Article, and FAQ schema are critical for GEO. Use SuperSchema to generate error-free markup that AI models trust."
  },
  {
    question: 'Which schema types matter most for GEO?',
    answer: "Organization schema (establishes entity authority), Article schema (provides content context), FAQ schema (direct answer formatting), and Author schema (builds E-E-A-T signals). These schema types signal to AI that your content is credible, well-structured, and training-worthy. SuperSchema automatically detects which schema types you need based on your content."
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I measure GEO success?',
    answer: "Check if your brand appears in ChatGPT responses, Perplexity citations, and Google AI Overviews. Monitor your entity's presence across AI platforms. Track brand mentions in AI-generated answers (even without links - visibility builds authority). Use tools like SuperSchema to ensure your schema quality score is 80+ for better AI parsing. GEO success isn't about clicks - it's about becoming the default source AI cites."
  },
  {
    question: 'Is GEO just for big brands?',
    answer: "No. GEO levels the playing field. Small brands with strong schema, clear entity definitions, and credible content can outrank Fortune 500 companies in AI-generated answers. AI doesn't care about your brand size - it cares about authority signals. If your content is well-structured, cited, and authoritative, AI will use it as a training source regardless of your company size."
  },
  {
    question: 'Can GEO hurt my SEO?',
    answer: "Only if you do it wrong. Invalid schema gets ignored. Schema that doesn't match visible content can trigger penalties. But properly implemented GEO? Pure upside. It enhances your SEO by making your content more parseable, more authoritative, and more citation-worthy across both traditional search engines and AI platforms. GEO and SEO work together - strong schema benefits both."
  },
  {
    question: 'When will GEO become critical?',
    answer: "It already is. Over 1 billion prompts are sent to ChatGPT daily. 71% of Americans use AI search to research purchases. By 2027, LLM traffic will overtake traditional Google search. The brands optimizing for GEO now will dominate AI discovery in 2026. Waiting means losing ground to competitors who are already building entity authority. Start implementing GEO today - your future visibility depends on it."

          <p>
            Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) is the practice of optimizing your content to become the training source that AI models - ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google Gemini, Claude, and others - rely on when generating answers.

            While <a href="/aeo" class="text-primary hover:underline">AEO</a> focuses on getting cited in AI-generated answers, GEO goes deeper - it's about becoming the authoritative source that AI can't write an answer without. Think of it as earning a permanent spot in the AI knowledge base.

          <p>
            Schema isn't optional for GEO - it's mandatory. Structured data is how AI models understand entities, relationships, authorship, and credibility. Without schema, you're just text on a page. With schema, you're a trusted, parseable source.
          </p>
          <p>
            Think of schema as machine-readable credibility signals. AI models parse Organization schema to understand who you are. Article schema provides content context and authorship. FAQ schema formats direct answers that AI loves to cite.
